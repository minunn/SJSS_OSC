# SJSS_OSC
spaghetti js server for handle all stuff from my custom osc vrcx ! You need water to use this ! If you don't have any water it will just not work and vrcx will give you no logs !
this was made 6 month ago in like 1 hour since i needed something to get logs on discord for friends and show what is going on in my rooms and can also help friends detect easly crashers etc
